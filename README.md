# Welcome!
## The ALX System Engineering Devops Projects.


The ALX System Engineering Deveops project is mainly based on basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting and more advancing topics.

- At ALX we are given projects to complete each day and push to Github, these projects will be automically reviewed each day with a score checking technology.
- This repository contains all the projects I worked on within the 1 year ALX Software Engineering Program.

## The quote below serves as a motivation.
