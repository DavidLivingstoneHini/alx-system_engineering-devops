# Welcome!
## The ALX System Engineering Devops Projects.


The ALX System Engineering Devops project is mainly based on basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting and more advancing topics.

- At ALX we learn by taking on real projects, we are given projects to complete each day and push to Github, these projects are automatically reviewed each day with a score checking tool.
- This repository contains some of the projects I worked on within the 1 year ALX Software Engineering Program.
